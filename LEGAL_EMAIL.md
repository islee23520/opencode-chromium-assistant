Subject: Request: Branding & Bundling Permissions for OpenCode Assistant in Chromium-based distribution

Hello OpenCode team,

I'm the maintainer of a small Chromium-based project that integrates OpenCode as a privacy-first AI assistant using a BYOM approach (users supply their OpenCode API key). The repository is here:

https://github.com/islee23520/opencode-chromium-assistant

Before we ship or pre-select OpenCode as the default provider in distributed builds, we would like to confirm the following in writing:

1) Branding permission: May we display a "Powered by OpenCode" text badge in the UI and in our README? If you prefer specific wording or a disclaimer, please let us know.

2) Default pre-selection: Are there any commercial/legal constraints for setting OpenCode as the pre-selected default provider in a Chromium-based distribution? If a written agreement is required for default bundling, please point us to the appropriate contact.

3) Data use & training: Does OpenCode use API request content or response content for model training or retention? Are there enterprise plans that opt out of training/retention? Please confirm the privacy guarantees for API customers.

4) Proxy usage: If we later implement an optional Brave-managed proxy (server-held credentials) for UX reasons, what terms/licensing and SLAs would OpenCode require for that setup?

5) Trademark / logo usage: If there are any brand assets or trademark guidelines, please provide the recommended assets or a link to your brand guidelines.

We are happy to provide expected usage volumes and additional project details if that helps. If you'd like a contract or MSA for pre-selection or proxy-based deployment, please advise on next steps or a contact person.

Thanks in advance — we want to ensure our integration complies with OpenCode terms and that we honor any brand or legal requirements.

Best,
