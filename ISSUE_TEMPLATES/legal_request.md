# Legal: Request for branding & bundling permission

Hello OpenCode team,

We are building a Chromium-based integration that makes OpenCode the default AI provider using a BYOM (Bring Your Own Model/API Key) approach. Before shipping or pre-selecting OpenCode as the default provider in distributed builds, we would like written confirmation on the following:

1. Permission to use the phrase "Powered by OpenCode" in the product UI and README.
2. Confirmation that OpenCode allows pre-selection of OpenCode as the default provider in a third-party Chromium distribution (if any special terms apply).
3. Data retention and training policy for API users (do OpenCode use prompts/outputs for model training? If so, is there an enterprise plan that opts out?).
4. Any trademark usage guidelines or assets we should use.

Project details:
- Repo: https://github.com/islee23520/opencode-chromium-assistant
- Contact/POC: islee23520

Please advise on the next steps or provide a legal contact to continue the discussion. We are happy to sign an agreement if required for proxy-based proxying or default bundling.

Thanks,
The Opencode Chromium Assistant team
