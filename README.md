# Opencode Chromium Assistant

Chromium-based assistant: a minimal integration blueprint that makes OpenCode the default AI provider using a BYOM (Bring Your Own Model/API Key) approach. Privacy-first: assistant is disabled by default and requires explicit user opt-in.

Note on AI assistance: Some files in this repository (PoC prototype and CHROMIUM_INTEGRATION.md) were generated or assisted by AI tools (OpenCode). See CITATION.md for details.

This repository contains the Chromium-specific integration plan, initial design artifacts, and a PoC mock server for local development.
